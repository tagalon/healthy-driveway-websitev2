      'My family and I were trying to put our house on the market, so we reached out to Healthy Driveway as their prices are much more affordable compared with other DFW businesses. Our 11-year old driveway used to have all sorts of gunk trapped within the crevices, but now it is cleaner than ever! By doing this, we were able to sell the house as our exterior surfaces looked brand new!',

      'I decided to contact Healthy Driveway as my lovely children suffer severely from pollen allergies. Pollen sticks to the driveway and as of quarantine, our kids spend most of their time outside on our driveway itself. As our kids have actually experienced severe allergic reactions, we decided to contact Healthy Driveway to help out with our situation. We are so happy with the results from Healthy Driveway as our kids haven\'t been showing any symptons recently! Thank you so much Healthy Driveway!',

      'As both an elder and mechanic, I tend to work alot on my driveway as I am always working on personal projects which resulted in a very dirty driveway. I decided to hire Healthy Driveway to give back to my community and also for having afforable pricing. These young workers also took note of my age and practiced social distancing for the sake of my health. Thanks to Healthy Driveway, I also won\'t have to fear my tires popping again as well!',
